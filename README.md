# intent
Vocab about Offer, Request, Want, Need, Desire, and other related predecessors to [exchanges](https://github.com/openvocab/exchange) or [processes](https://github.com/valueflows/process). .

We see many groups posting intents that are different from commercial advertisements or ecommerce offers.

They are more general, often not commercial at all, expressed not in identified products but in categories, tags, and text.  But they want to find each other. The offers want to find the matching wants. The wants want to find the matching offers.

Tentatively, Intent has three main subtypes: intent to **Give** something, intent to **Take** or receive something, and **Propose** (to do something). People use their own situationally varied names for them. **Offer** is probably the most common word for Give. **Want** or Need are other words for Take.

When they find their match, those with the matching Offer and Want enter into a conversation for action which might result in an [exchange](https://github.com/valueflows/exchange).

A proposal to do something might enter into conversation for action which might result in a [process](https://github.com/valueflows/process).

Some of the groups we have seen posting these intents include [Mutual Aid Networks](http://www.mutualaidnetwork.org/), [Mutual Credit Associations](https://www.community-exchange.org/home/), and [Hylo](https://www.hylo.com/c/collaborative-technology-alliance).

The aim of this repository is to collect their use cases and potential valueflows vocabulary additions.

Intents may lead to conversations for action, which may lead to more and better cycles of engagement:
